# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer
The `name` variable is global, but the `nameToChange` variable only exists inside the function `changeName`. Even though we assigned a new value to `nameToChange` inside the function, it doesn't affect the value of the `name` variable outside the function.Primitive data types are always passed by value.  In the case of `favoriteLocations`, we are able to change the array because arrays are passed by reference. Any methods or modifications applied to the array inside the function will directly affect the original array outside the function.
